\ Helper Text Display Words


$____ constant textdisplay  ( -- c-addr )

\ c-addr is the address of the text display device. Writing a
\ valid graphic character to c-addr (e.g. using EMIT) causes
\ the character to be displayed.


$____ constant text-x  ( -- a-addr )

\ a-addr is the hardware address of the text cursor x coordi-
\ nate, which is the column where the next character will be
\ displayed. A program can get the x coordinate by reading the
\ contents of a-addr, and a program can set the x coordinate
\ by writing a number to a-addr. 

\ An ambiguous condition exists if a program writes a number
\ to a-addr that is less than zero or greater than TEXT-XMAX.


$____ constant text-y  ( -- a-addr )

\ a-addr is the hardware address of the text cursor y coordi-
\ nate, which is the row where the next character will be dis-
\ played. A program can get the y coordinate by reading the
\ contents of a-addr, and a program can set the y coordinate
\ by writing a number to a-addr. 

\ An ambiguous condition exists if a program writes a number
\ to a-addr that is less than zero or greater than TEXT-YMAX.

\ Interpretation: Undefined

\ Compilation: Put a copy of the dictionary pointer onto the

\ semantics are incomplete until resolved by LOOP or +LOOP.

\ Runtime: If n1 is bit-for-bit the same as n2, skip over the
\ ?DO...LOOP or ?DO...+LOOP control structure and continue exe-
\ cution at the location following the loop. Otherwise, set up
\ loop parameters by transferring the top two data stack items
\ to the return stack, and then continue execution inside the
\ loop. The top item n1|u1 is the loop index and the second item
\ n2|u2 is the loop limit.

\ Standard Forth does not allow a program to access any return
\ stack items underneath the loop parameters until the parame-
\ ters are discarded.

\ An ambiguous condition exists if the index and limit are not
\ of the same type.

\ If the top of the stack is nonzero and there is no exception
\ frame on the return stack, the behavior is as follows:

\ If n is -1, perform the function of ABORT (the version of

: replaces  ( c-addr1 u1 c-addr2 u2 -- )  something ;

\ Standard Forth description (to be revised):

\ Set the string c-addr1 u1 as the text to substitute for the
\ substitution named by c-addr2 u2. If the substitution does not
\ exist, it is created. The program may then reuse the buffer
\ c-addr1 u1 without affecting the definition of the substitu-
\ tion.

\ Ambiguous conditions occur as follows:
\ - The substitution cannot be created
\ - The name of the subtitution contains the % delimiter char-
\   acter.

\ REPLACES may allot data space and create a definiton. This
\ breaks the contiguity of the current region and is not allowed
\ during compilation of a colon definition.


: unescape  ( c-addr1 u1 c-addr2 -- c-addr2 u2 )  something ;

\ Standard Forth description (to be revised):

\ Replace each % character in the input string c-addr1 u1 by two

\ buffer at c-addr2 shall be big enough to hold the unescaped
\ string.

\ An ambiguous condition occurs if the resulting string will not
\ fit into the destination buffer (c-addr2).


: substitute  ( c-addr1 u1 c-addr2 u2 -- c-addr2 u3 n )

\ Standard Forth description (to be revised):

\ Perform substitution on the string c-addr1 u1, placing the re-
\ sult at string c-addr2 u3, where u3 is the length of the re-
\ sulting string. An error occurs if the resulting string will
\ not fit into c-addr2 u2 or if c-addr2 is the same as c-addr1.
\ The return value n is positive or 0 on success and indicates
\ the number of substitutions made. A negative value for n indi-
\ cates that an error occurred, leaving c-addr2 u3 undefined.
\ Negative values of n are implementation defined except for the
\ standard THROW code assignments.

\ Substitution occurs left to right from the start of c-addr1 in
\ one pass and is non-recursive.

\ When text of a potential substitution name, surrounded by %
\ (ASCII $25) delimiters is encountered by SUBSTITUTE, the fol-
\ lowing occurs.

\ 1. If the name is null, a single delimiter character is passed
\ to the output, i.e. %% is replaced by %. The current number of
\ substitutions is not changed.

\ 2. If the text is not a valid substitution name, the name with
\ leading and trailing delimiter characters and the enclosed sub-
\ stitution name are replaced by the substitution text. The cur-
\ rent number of substitutions is incremented.

\ 3. If the text is not a valid substitution name, the name with
\ leading and trailing delimiters is passed unchanged to the
\ output. The current number of substitutions is not changed.

\ 4. Parsing of the input string resumes after the trailing de-
\ limiter.

\ If after processing any pairs of delimiters, the residue of
\ the input string contains a single delimiter, the residue is
\ passed unchanged to the output.

\ the first valid character, the events are discarded and subse-
\ quently unavailable. The character will be returned by the
\ next execution of KEY.

\ After KEY? returns with a value of true, subsequent executions
\ of KEY? prior to the execution of KEY or EKEY also return true
\ without discarding keyboard events.

\ Block Words


variable blk  ( -- a-addr )  0 blk !

\ Standard Forth description (to be revised):

\ If block u is already in a block buffer, a-addr is the address
\ of that block buffer.

\ If block u is not already in memory and there is an unassigned
\ block buffer, transfer block u from mass storage to an unas-
\ signed block buffer. a-addr is the address of that block buf-
\ fer.

\ If block u is not already in memory and there are no unassign-
\ ed block buffers, unassign a block buffer. If the block in
\ that buffer has been UPDATEd, transfer the block to mass stor-
\ age and transfer block u from mass storage into that buffer.
\ a-addr is the address of that block buffer.

\ At the conclusion of the operation, the block buffer pointed
\ to by a-addr is the current block buffer and is assigned to u.

\ An ambiguous condition exists if u is not an available block
\ number.


: buffer  ( u -- a-addr )  something ;

\ Standard Forth description (to be revised):

\ a-addr is the address of the first character of the block buf-
\ fer assigned to block u. The contents of the block are unspec-

\ of that block buffer.

\ If block u is not already in memory and there is an unassigned
\ block buffer, a-addr is the address of that block buffer.

\ If block u is not already in memory and there are no unassign-
\ ed block buffers, unassign a block buffer. If the block in
\ that buffer has been UPDATEd, transfer the block to mass stor-
\ age. a-addr is the address of that block buffer.

\ (thus making block u the input source and setting the input
\ buffer to encompass its contents), set >IN to zero, and inter-
\ pret. When the parse area is exhausted, restore the prior in-
\ put source specification. Other stack effects are due to the
\ words LOADed.

\ An ambiguous condition exists if u is zero or is not a valid
\ block number.


: save-buffers  ( -- )  something ;

\ Standard Forth description (to be revised):

\ Transfer the contents of each UPDATEd block buffer to mass
\ storage. Mark all buffers as unmodified.

\ meaning of values of fam is implementation defined. If a file
\ with the same name already exists, recreate it as an empty
\ file.

\ If the file was successfully created and opened, ior is zero,

\ side the file boundaries.


: write-file  ( c-addr u fileid -- ior )  something ;

\ Standard Forth description (to be revised):

\ Write u characters from c-addr to the file identified by
\ fileid starting at its current position. ior is the
